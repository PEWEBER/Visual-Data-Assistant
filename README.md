# Visual-Data-Assistant
I worked on this as a group project. As a group we designed what we like to call the Visual Data Assisstant. Students control the device through the use of an XBox Kinect connected to a projector. The Visual Data Assistant displays to-do list items that can be entered in by the user and checked off as tasks are completed. Every time tasks are completed you earn points that you can use on rewards such as a coffee break or video games.

The Visual Data Assistant is written in Javascript.
